# Machine Learning in String Theory: Literature Review

This repository contains a list of machine learning papers relevant to string
theory, along with supporting notebooks and calculations. Calculations are
generally provided as Python code and Jupyter notebooks. In some places
Mathematica code is provided too given its familiarity to physicists.

See [`papers.md`](papers.md) for a summary of relevant papers.
